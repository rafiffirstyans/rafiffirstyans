👋 Hello there! I'm Rafif Firstyan, a passionate junior programmer with a flair for coding even while pursuing my high school education. 🎓 Currently enrolled in SMK BINA MANDIRI MULTIMEDIA, I'm on a journey to explore the realms of software development and technology.

💻 Despite being a student, I'm deeply engaged in honing my programming skills, delving into languages like HTML,CSS, JS. and exploring various frameworks and tools to bring my ideas to life. 🚀

🌟 My GitHub repositories reflect my enthusiasm for learning and experimentation. From simple projects to more complex ones, each piece of code is a testament to my growth and dedication to the craft.

🔍 Always eager to collaborate and learn from fellow developers, I believe in the power of community and knowledge-sharing. Let's connect and embark on this coding journey together!
